      "summary": "AI agents keep getting better, but their biggest headache has been context. Every tool wants its own rules file, so your project knowledge splinters across claude.md, gemini.md, cursor.md, and more. A new shared standard called agents.md aims to fix that by giving every agent one place to load instructions, workflows, and project memory at startup.\n\nFirst, let’s look at the earlier bottleneck that Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol, or M-C-P, solved. Before M-C-P, developers had to handcraft integrations for each model-tool pair. M-C-P standardized how models talk to tools, so any compliant client could connect to any compliant server. That cleaned up tool calling, but it didn’t solve how agents remember the right rules and project state across different apps.\n\nNow, here’s the current pain point. Effective agents depend on solid context engineering: clear rules, workflows, and up-to-date project state. Claude Code, for example, auto-loads a claude.md file if it’s present in your repo, so it starts with your instructions and workflow without being prompted. But as you hop between tools—Cursor, CodeEX from OpenAI, the Gemini command-line interface, or Quen Code—you end up duplicating that same context into gemini.md, cursor.md, and others. Edits go stale, progress gets trapped in tool-specific files, and you’re constantly reminding agents to refresh or re-sync. Even prominent developers like ShadCN have called out the configuration sprawl as unsustainable.\n\nThe most important finding is that agents.md consolidates all of that. The idea is simple: create a single agents.md file at the project root, and compatible agents will automatically read it at session start. OpenAI is pushing this as a common context standard, and a growing list of tools already support it, including CodeEX, the Gemini CLI and tools built on it like Quen Code, plus Cursor and several web apps such as Factory and Google Jewels. With one source of truth, your rules, project state, and workflows stay consistent no matter which agent you test or switch to.\n\nMoving on to practical details, agents don’t need to abandon their legacy files. They can keep supporting claude.md or tool-specific configs while also reading agents.md. That’s crucial for teams mid-transition or for mixed-tool environments where not every agent updates at the same pace. The workflow becomes: put your canonical instructions and active project context in agents.md, let updated agents consume it automatically, and keep any tool-specific file only if a particular agent still requires it.\n\nHowever, there’s a catch. Claude Code—arguably the most capable coding agent today—is not yet on the public adopters list. Adoption depends on Anthropic adding support. Nothing prevents Claude Code from reading both claude.md and agents.md, and if it did, switching between Claude, Cursor, and Gemini-based tools would become nearly frictionless. Until then, developers who rely on Claude Code may still need to mirror their context in claude.md, or use agents.md as the canonical file and manually copy updates into Claude’s file when needed.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Agents.md doesn’t change model intelligence; it standardizes project memory. If you test or rotate between agents, it’s a big time saver and reduces errors from out-of-sync rules. Start by creating agents.md as your single source of truth, structure it with your core rules, workflows, and live project state, and keep legacy files only where necessary. If Claude Code is your main driver, you’ll get the full benefits once Anthropic supports agents.md; until then, use agents.md now and keep Claude’s file in sync. The value is clear: less duplication, fewer context bugs, and faster switching between tools—exactly what modern AI development needs.",
