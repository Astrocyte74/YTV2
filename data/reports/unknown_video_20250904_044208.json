  "transcript": "ARTHUR BROOKS: You\nneed to be bored. You will have less\nmeaning and you will be more depressed\nif you never are bored. I mean, it couldn't be clearer. Let me give you the good\nside of boredom in general. Boredom is a tendency\nfor us to not be occupied otherwise cognitively, which\nswitches over our thinking system to use a\npart of our brain that's called the\ndefault mode network. That sounds fancy. It's really not. The default mode\nnetwork is a bunch of structures in your\nbrain that switch on when you don't have\nanything else to think about. So you forgot your\nphone and you're sitting at a light, for example. That's when your default\nmode network goes on. We don't like it. My colleague in the\npsychology department here at Harvard, Dan\nGilbert, he did experiments where people had to\nsit in a room for 15 minutes with instructions\nto do absolutely nothing, and there was nothing\nin the room to do, except there was a\nbutton in front of them that they could push. And if they did,\nthey gave themselves a painful electric shock. Sit there bored, or get a shock. A big majority of\nthe participants gave themselves shocks instead\nof thinking about nothing. We don't like boredom. Boredom is boredom is terrible. Why is boredom so bad? Well, because the default\nmode network makes us think about things that\nmight be kind of uncomfortable. When you think about nothing\nwhile your mind wanders and thinks about, for example,\nbig questions of meaning in your life. What does my life mean? You go to uncomfortable\nexistential questions when you're bored. That turns out to be incredibly\nimportant, incredibly good. One of the reasons we have\nsuch an explosion of depression and anxiety in our society\ntoday is because people actually don't know the meaning\nof their lives, much less so in\nprevious generations. Tons of data show this,\nand furthermore, we're not even looking. Why not? I'll tell you why not. We figured out a way\nto eliminate boredom. We've been able,\nalmost completely, to shut off the default\nmode network in our brains. How? The answer is that thing in\nyour pocket with the screen, which you take out even when\nyou're standing on the street corner waiting for\nthe light to change, is like, I might have to\nwait here for 15 seconds. What are you doing? You're actually trying to not be\nbored because the default mode network is mildly uncomfortable,\nbecause it sends you to the types of questions that\nyou can't get your mind around. You can't get your arms around. Well, that's a big problem. That's a doom loop of meaning. If every time you're slightly\nbored pull out your phone, it's going to get harder and\nharder for you to find meaning, and that's the recipe for\ndepression and anxiety and a sense of hollowness,\nwhich, by the way, are all through the roof. I get it. You don't want to be bored. You need to be bored. Be bored more. Tomorrow, when you go to\nthe gym in the morning after you wake up,\ndon't take your phone. Can you handle it? Not listening to a podcast\nwhile you're working out. Just being in your head. I promise you, you'll have\nyour most interesting ideas while you're working\nout without devices. It's probably been a long\ntime since you've done that. Commute with nothing,\nnot even the radio. Can you do that? Start getting better\nat periods that are 15 minutes and\nlonger of boredom, and watch your life change. Number one, you'll be less\nbored with ordinary things in your life. If you get better at\nthe skill of boredom, you'll be less\nbored with your job. You'll be less bored\nwith your relationships. You'll be less bored\nwith the things that are going on around you. But more importantly,\nyou'll start digging into the biggest questions in\nyour life, purpose, meaning, coherence, significance. And who knows? You might just get happier. People ask me all the\ntime, is the doctor taking his own prescriptions? And the answer is, yes. Yes, I am. I'm prone to the same\npathologies as anybody else because I have the same brain\nchemistry as everybody else. So what do I do to fight that? And the answer is, well,\nI do a number of things. I have a no device policy\nafter 7:00 in the afternoon. I don't sleep with my phone. We don't have devices when\nwe have meals in my family. Because we're there\nfor each other. We're not there for\npeople who aren't there. Three, I have\nregular social media and screen cleanses where\nI don't use my device for longer periods of time. First, it's like children\nscreaming in my head because that's how dopamine\nis saying, get the phone, get the phone. That's addiction. But it calms down\nand I feel better. And I feel sort of\nblessed by the end. And I pick the\nphone up by the end because I have to\ncheck my emails. And I have to be a normal,\nfunctioning, connected person in the world. But it does remind me that my\nlife doesn't have to revolve around these devices. These protocols are\nreally, really helpful and I recommend them to\nanybody and everybody. Don't sleep with your phone. No phones during meals. Regular social media fasts. You'll get better. People worry that if\nthey do these things, they're going to miss something. There are ways that\nyou can remedy that. One of the things\nthat you can do is you can have your phone on. You're just not looking\nat it, and there's only one or two numbers\nthat can reach you in case of emergencies. Phones can do that by the way. If you don't have to\ndo that, ask your kid. But don't use emergencies\nin as an excuse. Here's something that's\nnot an emergency. What's going on Twitter. That's not an emergency\nanswer nothing. It doesn't matter. The news can wait. Seriously your\ngrandparents didn't what was going on every single\nsecond in Washington, DC. You're killing yourself\nwith this stuff. Are you kidding me? It's bad for you. So let me say it\nstraight to my kids. Put down your phones. You need more\nmeaning in your life. And so do I.",

    "summary": "You need boredom. Not as a punishment, but as a feature your brain relies on to build meaning, reduce anxiety, and spark fresh ideas. Constant stimulation might feel good in the moment, but it quietly shuts down the very mental processes that help you feel grounded and happy.\n\nFirst, let’s get clear on what boredom really is. When you’re not occupied—say you’re sitting at a red light with nothing to do—your brain switches to what’s called the default mode network. It’s not a fancy add-on; it’s your mind’s natural “idle” system, designed to wander, connect dots, and surface big-picture questions about your life.\n\nHere’s why we resist it. That wandering often drifts into uncomfortable territory—purpose, coherence, regrets, hopes. In one striking study, people were asked to sit alone with their thoughts for 15 minutes, with the option to press a button that delivered a painful electric shock. A lot of them chose the shock over sitting in silence. That’s how uncomfortable boredom can feel.\n\nBut discomfort doesn’t mean danger. In fact, this is the point. Those quiet, fidgety moments are when meaning-making happens. Today, many people feel less certain about what their lives are for, and we’re not even giving ourselves the stillness required to explore it. Why? Because we’ve figured out how to eliminate boredom on demand.\n\nMoving on to the culprit, it’s the screen in your pocket. Even if you’re just waiting 15 seconds to cross the street, it’s easy to tap, scroll, and instantly switch off your default mode network. Do that all day, and you create a doom loop: the less time your mind gets to wander, the less meaning it can assemble; the less meaning you feel, the more you reach for your phone to numb the discomfort—fueling anxiety, depression, and hollowness.\n\nSo what helps? Start by deliberately practicing boredom. Tomorrow’s workout, leave the phone at home. No podcasts, no music—just your thoughts. You’ll likely notice your most interesting ideas show up when nothing else is competing for your attention. On your commute, try silence instead of radio or playlists. Aim for stretches of 15 minutes or longer. As your tolerance grows, ordinary life becomes more engaging—you’ll feel less bored at work, less restless in relationships, and more curious about everyday moments.\n\nWhen it comes to practical boundaries, a few simple rules go a long way. Set a no-device cutoff in the evening—say after 7:00 p.m.—so your brain can downshift. Don’t sleep with your phone in the bedroom; use an alarm clock instead. Keep meals phone-free so attention goes to the people who are actually there. Add regular social media or screen “cleanses”—periods when you step away entirely. At first, your dopamine system will scream for a hit. Give it a little time, and your mind will settle. You’ll remember what it feels like to be present.\n\nWorried about emergencies? Use your phone’s settings to allow calls or messages from one or two key numbers to break through while everything else stays quiet. Just don’t let “what if” become an excuse to keep doomscrolling. Twitter is not an emergency. The news can wait. Your grandparents lived fine without minute-by-minute updates, and your mental health will thank you for reclaiming that space.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Boredom isn’t a bug—it’s the gateway to meaning, creativity, and emotional stability. Protect device-free time, start small with 15-minute windows, keep phones out of the bedroom, and make meals a no-screen zone. Expect some early discomfort, then watch clarity, calm, and deeper relationships take its place. Put the phone down more often, let your mind wander, and give your life the quiet it needs to make sense.",
