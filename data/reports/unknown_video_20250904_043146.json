  "transcript": "ARTHUR BROOKS: You\nneed to be bored. You will have less\nmeaning and you will be more depressed\nif you never are bored. I mean, it couldn't be clearer. Let me give you the good\nside of boredom in general. Boredom is a tendency\nfor us to not be occupied otherwise cognitively, which\nswitches over our thinking system to use a\npart of our brain that's called the\ndefault mode network. That sounds fancy. It's really not. The default mode\nnetwork is a bunch of structures in your\nbrain that switch on when you don't have\nanything else to think about. So you forgot your\nphone and you're sitting at a light, for example. That's when your default\nmode network goes on. We don't like it. My colleague in the\npsychology department here at Harvard, Dan\nGilbert, he did experiments where people had to\nsit in a room for 15 minutes with instructions\nto do absolutely nothing, and there was nothing\nin the room to do, except there was a\nbutton in front of them that they could push. And if they did,\nthey gave themselves a painful electric shock. Sit there bored, or get a shock. A big majority of\nthe participants gave themselves shocks instead\nof thinking about nothing. We don't like boredom. Boredom is boredom is terrible. Why is boredom so bad? Well, because the default\nmode network makes us think about things that\nmight be kind of uncomfortable. When you think about nothing\nwhile your mind wanders and thinks about, for example,\nbig questions of meaning in your life. What does my life mean? You go to uncomfortable\nexistential questions when you're bored. That turns out to be incredibly\nimportant, incredibly good. One of the reasons we have\nsuch an explosion of depression and anxiety in our society\ntoday is because people actually don't know the meaning\nof their lives, much less so in\nprevious generations. Tons of data show this,\nand furthermore, we're not even looking. Why not? I'll tell you why not. We figured out a way\nto eliminate boredom. We've been able,\nalmost completely, to shut off the default\nmode network in our brains. How? The answer is that thing in\nyour pocket with the screen, which you take out even when\nyou're standing on the street corner waiting for\nthe light to change, is like, I might have to\nwait here for 15 seconds. What are you doing? You're actually trying to not be\nbored because the default mode network is mildly uncomfortable,\nbecause it sends you to the types of questions that\nyou can't get your mind around. You can't get your arms around. Well, that's a big problem. That's a doom loop of meaning. If every time you're slightly\nbored pull out your phone, it's going to get harder and\nharder for you to find meaning, and that's the recipe for\ndepression and anxiety and a sense of hollowness,\nwhich, by the way, are all through the roof. I get it. You don't want to be bored. You need to be bored. Be bored more. Tomorrow, when you go to\nthe gym in the morning after you wake up,\ndon't take your phone. Can you handle it? Not listening to a podcast\nwhile you're working out. Just being in your head. I promise you, you'll have\nyour most interesting ideas while you're working\nout without devices. It's probably been a long\ntime since you've done that. Commute with nothing,\nnot even the radio. Can you do that? Start getting better\nat periods that are 15 minutes and\nlonger of boredom, and watch your life change. Number one, you'll be less\nbored with ordinary things in your life. If you get better at\nthe skill of boredom, you'll be less\nbored with your job. You'll be less bored\nwith your relationships. You'll be less bored\nwith the things that are going on around you. But more importantly,\nyou'll start digging into the biggest questions in\nyour life, purpose, meaning, coherence, significance. And who knows? You might just get happier. People ask me all the\ntime, is the doctor taking his own prescriptions? And the answer is, yes. Yes, I am. I'm prone to the same\npathologies as anybody else because I have the same brain\nchemistry as everybody else. So what do I do to fight that? And the answer is, well,\nI do a number of things. I have a no device policy\nafter 7:00 in the afternoon. I don't sleep with my phone. We don't have devices when\nwe have meals in my family. Because we're there\nfor each other. We're not there for\npeople who aren't there. Three, I have\nregular social media and screen cleanses where\nI don't use my device for longer periods of time. First, it's like children\nscreaming in my head because that's how dopamine\nis saying, get the phone, get the phone. That's addiction. But it calms down\nand I feel better. And I feel sort of\nblessed by the end. And I pick the\nphone up by the end because I have to\ncheck my emails. And I have to be a normal,\nfunctioning, connected person in the world. But it does remind me that my\nlife doesn't have to revolve around these devices. These protocols are\nreally, really helpful and I recommend them to\nanybody and everybody. Don't sleep with your phone. No phones during meals. Regular social media fasts. You'll get better. People worry that if\nthey do these things, they're going to miss something. There are ways that\nyou can remedy that. One of the things\nthat you can do is you can have your phone on. You're just not looking\nat it, and there's only one or two numbers\nthat can reach you in case of emergencies. Phones can do that by the way. If you don't have to\ndo that, ask your kid. But don't use emergencies\nin as an excuse. Here's something that's\nnot an emergency. What's going on Twitter. That's not an emergency\nanswer nothing. It doesn't matter. The news can wait. Seriously your\ngrandparents didn't what was going on every single\nsecond in Washington, DC. You're killing yourself\nwith this stuff. Are you kidding me? It's bad for you. So let me say it\nstraight to my kids. Put down your phones. You need more\nmeaning in your life. And so do I.",

    "summary": "Boredom isn’t a bug in your life; it’s a feature. If you never let yourself be bored, you blunt your capacity for meaning and make it easier to feel anxious, depressed, and hollow. The counterintuitive truth is simple: you need boredom on purpose.\n\nFirst, let’s get clear on what boredom does in your brain. When you’re not occupied, your Default Mode Network, or D-M-N, switches on. It’s the set of brain regions that lights up when you have nothing to do—like when you forget your phone and sit at a red light. Most of us dislike that feeling. In a well-known Harvard experiment, people sat alone for 15 minutes with nothing but a button that delivered a painful electric shock. A big majority chose the shock over sitting with their thoughts. That’s how uncomfortable boredom can feel.\n\nWhy is it so uncomfortable? Because the D-M-N steers you toward big questions—purpose, meaning, coherence, significance. These are hard, sometimes unsettling topics. But leaning into them is exactly how you build a meaningful life. Here’s the catch: we’ve learned to shut that system off almost entirely. The screen in your pocket fills every spare moment, even 15 seconds at a crosswalk, and it short-circuits the mental space where deep ideas form. That creates a doom loop: the more you reach for stimulation at the first hint of boredom, the less you practice meaning-making, and the more empty and anxious you feel.\n\nSo what should you do? Start scheduling boredom. Tomorrow, try the gym without your phone—no podcast, no music, just your thoughts. Commute in silence, not even the radio. Build up to 15-minute blocks, then longer. As you practice, two things happen. Ordinary life gets more interesting—work, relationships, everyday moments feel richer. And you naturally turn toward those bigger questions you’ve been avoiding, which is where insight lives.\n\nDaily habits make it stick. Set a no-device window after 7:00 p.m. Don’t sleep with your phone in the bedroom. Keep meals device-free so you’re fully present with the people who are actually there. Add regular social media or screen cleanses—go a day, or a weekend, without the apps. At first, your brain’s dopamine system will protest; it may feel like noise in your head urging you to check. Give it a little time and it calms down, and you remember your life doesn’t have to orbit a screen.\n\nWorried about emergencies? Use your phone’s settings so only one or two trusted numbers can break through while everything else stays quiet. And don’t confuse urgency with impulse. What’s happening on Twitter is not an emergency. The news can wait. Your grandparents didn’t consume minute-by-minute updates from Washington, D.C., and they were fine. Constant checking is what’s draining you.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Make boredom a daily practice to reactivate your Default Mode Network, surface meaningful questions, and reduce that hollow, anxious edge. Keep it simple: device-free workouts, silent commutes, no phones at meals, no phone after 7:00 p.m., and regular social media fasts with emergency bypass only. Put down your phone. Give your mind room to wander. That’s where the good ideas—and a more meaningful life—begin.",
