A few might see the scene in vivid detail. However, a small fraction of readers have a drastically different experience: within their heads, they \"see\" absolutely nothing. Why do some people have an inability to visualize images?

      "summary": "Some people can paint movies in their mind’s eye, while others see nothing at all. That inner visual experience lies on a spectrum, from aphantasia, where mental images don’t appear, to hyperphantasia, where imagery can feel almost as vivid as real sight. About 4% of people fall on the aphantasia end, with most of us landing somewhere in between.\n\nFirst, let’s look at how scientists know these differences are real and not just word games. One clue shows up in the eyes. When people imagine looking at a bright light, their pupils normally constrict a little, just as they would if the light were actually there. In people with aphantasia, that reflex doesn’t kick in during imagination, suggesting the visual system isn’t being driven by an internal image.\n\nMoving on to body responses, emotional imagery also shows a split. People who form mental pictures tend to show a slight sweat response during exciting scenes, even when simply imagining them. Those with aphantasia typically don’t show that reaction, likely because the emotional punch depends on the image their mind isn’t generating.\n\nThe most important finding was how the brain builds a picture in the first place. Deliberate visualization is a top-down process. Cognitive control regions light up first, then recruit memory and visual areas to assemble an image. People with hyperphantasia tend to have stronger connections along this route than those with aphantasia. However, dream imagery takes a different path. During sleep, deeper brain activity can spontaneously ignite memory and visual systems from the bottom up, which helps explain why people with aphantasia can still see vivid images in dreams.\n\nAs for causes, family patterns suggest a genetic influence on how vivid your mental canvas is. Many people with aphantasia have had it all their lives, though it can also develop after brain injury or with certain psychological conditions. Importantly, these imagery extremes aren’t classified as disorders. They’re variations in human experience, each with trade-offs.\n\nWhen it comes to memory and emotion, those with hyperphantasia often recall past events with more detail and can “relive” experiences more easily. That can be an advantage for learning and creativity, but it can also intensify negative imagery. There’s ongoing speculation that aphantasia may offer some protection against conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder, which often involve intrusive visual memories, though more research is needed.\n\nLooking at everyday life, imagery seems to nudge career preferences. In a survey of over 2,000 people, aphantasia was more common among those working in science, technology, engineering, and math, while hyperphantasia showed up more in the arts, media, and design. Different minds, different strengths.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Mental imagery isn’t one-size-fits-all; it spans a wide spectrum shaped by brain wiring, and neither end is “better.” If you don’t see pictures in your head, lean on other tools like verbal descriptions, diagrams, and step-by-step reasoning. If your images are intensely vivid, harness them for creativity and memory, and be mindful of their emotional impact. In the end, understanding your own mind’s eye helps you use it to your advantage.",
