  "transcript": "ARTHUR BROOKS: You\nneed to be bored. You will have less\nmeaning and you will be more depressed\nif you never are bored. I mean, it couldn't be clearer. Let me give you the good\nside of boredom in general. Boredom is a tendency\nfor us to not be occupied otherwise cognitively, which\nswitches over our thinking system to use a\npart of our brain that's called the\ndefault mode network. That sounds fancy. It's really not. The default mode\nnetwork is a bunch of structures in your\nbrain that switch on when you don't have\nanything else to think about. So you forgot your\nphone and you're sitting at a light, for example. That's when your default\nmode network goes on. We don't like it. My colleague in the\npsychology department here at Harvard, Dan\nGilbert, he did experiments where people had to\nsit in a room for 15 minutes with instructions\nto do absolutely nothing, and there was nothing\nin the room to do, except there was a\nbutton in front of them that they could push. And if they did,\nthey gave themselves a painful electric shock. Sit there bored, or get a shock. A big majority of\nthe participants gave themselves shocks instead\nof thinking about nothing. We don't like boredom. Boredom is boredom is terrible. Why is boredom so bad? Well, because the default\nmode network makes us think about things that\nmight be kind of uncomfortable. When you think about nothing\nwhile your mind wanders and thinks about, for example,\nbig questions of meaning in your life. What does my life mean? You go to uncomfortable\nexistential questions when you're bored. That turns out to be incredibly\nimportant, incredibly good. One of the reasons we have\nsuch an explosion of depression and anxiety in our society\ntoday is because people actually don't know the meaning\nof their lives, much less so in\nprevious generations. Tons of data show this,\nand furthermore, we're not even looking. Why not? I'll tell you why not. We figured out a way\nto eliminate boredom. We've been able,\nalmost completely, to shut off the default\nmode network in our brains. How? The answer is that thing in\nyour pocket with the screen, which you take out even when\nyou're standing on the street corner waiting for\nthe light to change, is like, I might have to\nwait here for 15 seconds. What are you doing? You're actually trying to not be\nbored because the default mode network is mildly uncomfortable,\nbecause it sends you to the types of questions that\nyou can't get your mind around. You can't get your arms around. Well, that's a big problem. That's a doom loop of meaning. If every time you're slightly\nbored pull out your phone, it's going to get harder and\nharder for you to find meaning, and that's the recipe for\ndepression and anxiety and a sense of hollowness,\nwhich, by the way, are all through the roof. I get it. You don't want to be bored. You need to be bored. Be bored more. Tomorrow, when you go to\nthe gym in the morning after you wake up,\ndon't take your phone. Can you handle it? Not listening to a podcast\nwhile you're working out. Just being in your head. I promise you, you'll have\nyour most interesting ideas while you're working\nout without devices. It's probably been a long\ntime since you've done that. Commute with nothing,\nnot even the radio. Can you do that? Start getting better\nat periods that are 15 minutes and\nlonger of boredom, and watch your life change. Number one, you'll be less\nbored with ordinary things in your life. If you get better at\nthe skill of boredom, you'll be less\nbored with your job. You'll be less bored\nwith your relationships. You'll be less bored\nwith the things that are going on around you. But more importantly,\nyou'll start digging into the biggest questions in\nyour life, purpose, meaning, coherence, significance. And who knows? You might just get happier. People ask me all the\ntime, is the doctor taking his own prescriptions? And the answer is, yes. Yes, I am. I'm prone to the same\npathologies as anybody else because I have the same brain\nchemistry as everybody else. So what do I do to fight that? And the answer is, well,\nI do a number of things. I have a no device policy\nafter 7:00 in the afternoon. I don't sleep with my phone. We don't have devices when\nwe have meals in my family. Because we're there\nfor each other. We're not there for\npeople who aren't there. Three, I have\nregular social media and screen cleanses where\nI don't use my device for longer periods of time. First, it's like children\nscreaming in my head because that's how dopamine\nis saying, get the phone, get the phone. That's addiction. But it calms down\nand I feel better. And I feel sort of\nblessed by the end. And I pick the\nphone up by the end because I have to\ncheck my emails. And I have to be a normal,\nfunctioning, connected person in the world. But it does remind me that my\nlife doesn't have to revolve around these devices. These protocols are\nreally, really helpful and I recommend them to\nanybody and everybody. Don't sleep with your phone. No phones during meals. Regular social media fasts. You'll get better. People worry that if\nthey do these things, they're going to miss something. There are ways that\nyou can remedy that. One of the things\nthat you can do is you can have your phone on. You're just not looking\nat it, and there's only one or two numbers\nthat can reach you in case of emergencies. Phones can do that by the way. If you don't have to\ndo that, ask your kid. But don't use emergencies\nin as an excuse. Here's something that's\nnot an emergency. What's going on Twitter. That's not an emergency\nanswer nothing. It doesn't matter. The news can wait. Seriously your\ngrandparents didn't what was going on every single\nsecond in Washington, DC. You're killing yourself\nwith this stuff. Are you kidding me? It's bad for you. So let me say it\nstraight to my kids. Put down your phones. You need more\nmeaning in your life. And so do I.",

    "summary": "You need boredom more than you think. When your mind isn’t occupied, it switches on a built‑in system that helps you grapple with meaning, purpose, and big life questions. If you dodge boredom every time it appears, you also dodge that deeper work, and over time you feel more hollow, anxious, and depressed.\n\nFirst, let’s look at what boredom actually does in the brain. When you’re not focused on a task, your default mode network, a set of brain regions that lights up in idle moments, takes over. It’s what kicks in when you forget your phone at a stoplight or sit quietly with nothing to do. That system nudges your mind toward introspection, memory, and the narrative of your life. It can feel uncomfortable, because it raises questions you can’t solve with a quick swipe.\n\nNow, why do we run from it? Because discomfort is real. In one experiment, adults were asked to sit for 15 minutes and do nothing, with only a button that delivered a painful electric shock. A majority chose to shock themselves rather than sit with their thoughts. That’s how strongly we avoid boredom.\n\nHere’s the catch: avoiding boredom is easy now, and that’s the problem. The phone in your pocket lets you zap every idle moment with novelty. You reach for it at the crosswalk, on the elevator, in line for coffee. That constant stimulation shuts off the default mode network, cuts down your time for reflection, and creates a doom loop: the more you avoid boredom, the less you ask what your life means, and the more empty and anxious you feel. Meanwhile, depression and anxiety are soaring.\n\nSo what should you do? Be bored on purpose. Start small and make it daily. First, try a workout with no phone, no podcast, no music—just your thoughts and your breath. It will feel weird at first, then ideas start showing up where noise used to be. Next, commute without the radio or a playlist. Give yourself at least 15 minutes at a time. As you build this muscle, you’ll find you’re less bored by ordinary life—work, relationships, errands—and more able to engage with them fully.\n\nWhen it comes to practical guardrails, keep your environment on your side. Set a no‑device policy after 7 p.m. Don’t sleep with your phone. Keep meals device‑free so attention goes to the people at the table, not the people who aren’t there. Schedule regular social media or screen “cleanses.” Expect withdrawal at first—your dopamine system will clamor for a hit—but it quiets down, and you feel clearer and calmer.\n\nWorried you’ll miss something urgent? Use your phone’s settings to let only one or two numbers bypass Do Not Disturb for true emergencies. Don’t let “breaking news” or social feeds masquerade as urgent. Your grandparents lived well without minute‑by‑minute updates, and you can too.\n\nSo what’s the bottom line? Let boredom back in. Those unfilled minutes turn on the part of your brain that weaves meaning, sparks ideas, and steadies your mood. Give yourself device‑free windows, practice at least 15 minutes of quiet daily, keep phones out of the bedroom and off the table, and take regular breaks from social media. Do less, on purpose—and you’ll make room for a life that feels fuller, clearer, and happier.",
